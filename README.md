## üìã Code philosophy

As a collective we have our development philosophy for create projects.
This philosophy is based on two simple points:
- The code should be readable for dummies.
- Difficult tasks should be broken down into simpler tasks.

To put this philosophy into practice we also try to comply with the [SOLID](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development contribution

### üíå Collaborate with a personal project

_Your project can be part of the collective._

Send us your project if you want us to publish it and for members of our community to keep it alive.
If your project is selected, you will become part of the group as project author and the authorship will be entirely yours.

Our bases for takes projects are simple:
- Project must be open source.
- The code must meet or come close to our development philosophy.

### üí° Collaborate with a idea

If you have a project idea, you can tell us about it. If we like it and we can do it, we will do it.

If the project is carried out, it will comply with our development philosophy and you will appear as the creator of the idea but not as the author.
